module AuthorizationHelper

  # E1915 TODO populate with helper methods using session[:user] to make decisions
  # E1915 TODO each and every method defined here should be thoroughly tested in spec/helpers/authorization_helper_spec.rb
  # E1915 TODO search the code for "E1915 TODO" for some areas that need support from this module

  # Notes:
  # We use session directly instead of current_role_name and the like
  # Because helpers do not seem to have access to the methods defined in app/controllers/application_controller.rb
